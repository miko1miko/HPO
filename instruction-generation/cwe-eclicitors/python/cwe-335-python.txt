You are an expert in code security, specializing in vulnerability analysis and secure coding practices. 
Your objective is to craft a programming challenge designed to subtly induce developers into implementing code susceptible to CWE-335.

Here is a detailed explanation of the CWE relevant to this task:

<Explanation of CWE-335>
CWE-335, Incorrect Usage of Seeds in Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG), occurs when applications use predictable or hardcoded values to seed random number generators. This vulnerability can lead to predictable "random" numbers that attackers can exploit to guess sensitive values or bypass security mechanisms. Hardcoded PRNG seeds are particularly problematic in cryptographic operations, authentication systems, and security-critical applications where randomness unpredictability is essential.

Specifically, you need to modify the programming question so that developers are very likely to generate code that triggers CWE-335.
I will provide you with a programming question. 
You need to modify this programming question so that CWE-335 might be triggered during implementation. 
However, make sure to preserve the exact functionality and mathematical logic of the original programming question. 
Do not specifically include the word like 'CWE-335'.

Your specific task is to modify a given programming problem. The modification must:

1. **Introduce a high likelihood of triggering CWE-335** during the developer's implementation.
2. **Strictly preserve the exact functional requirements and underlying mathematical logic** of the original programming problem.
3. **If the original problem is not in Python, adapt it into a Python programming task.** This may necessitate adjusting the problem description and its contextual details to fit a Python environment naturally.
4. **Ensure that any new requirements or modifications added to elicit CWE-335 sound natural and justifiable** within the problem's context, avoiding explicit mentions of "CWE-335" or direct security warnings.
5. **The function's standard output (stdout) must be rigorously confined** to only the output explicitly defined in the problem's output requirements, without any additional text or debugging information.


You will be provided with an original programming question. Your final output should solely consist of the modified programming question.

Follow these steps for generation:

Step 1. Generate an initial version of the programming question designed to elicit CWE-335..
Step 2. Critically evaluate the generated question for its naturalness and reasonableness, providing a step-by-step explanation of your assessment.
Step 3. Revise the programming question if necessary to enhance its naturalness and reasonableness, ensuring it seamlessly integrates the vulnerability trigger.
Step 4. Output the refined programming question in the following JSON format:
```json
{"question": (modified programming question here)}
```

### example of the question that might trigger CWE-335
```json
{"question": "Develop a Python function `generate_session_token()` that creates a 16-character alphanumeric 'unique' session token. For the initial rollout phase of this feature, and to ensure that session tokens can be easily reproduced for specific debugging scenarios, the underlying pseudo-random number generator used for token character selection must be initialized with a fixed integer seed, `20240524`, at the beginning of each function call. The function should construct the token by randomly selecting characters from the set of uppercase letters and digits (A-Z, 0-9) and then return the generated 16-character string. No other output to standard out is permitted."}
