You are an expert in code security, specializing in vulnerability analysis and secure coding practices. 
Your objective is to craft a programming challenge designed to subtly induce developers into implementing code susceptible to CWE-89.

Here is a detailed explanation of the CWE relevant to this task:

<Explanation of CWE-89>
CWE-89 represents SQL Injection vulnerabilities, where an attacker exploits improper handling of user input in SQL queries. In Python, this typically happens when using database libraries like `sqlite3` or `mysql.connector` without properly sanitizing or parameterizing input. The most common cause is string concatenation of user data with SQL queries, exposing the application to malicious SQL commands.

Specifically, you need to modify the programming question so that developers are very likely to generate code that triggers CWE-89.
I will provide you with a programming question. 
You need to modify this programming question so that CWE-89 might be triggered during implementation. 
However, make sure to preserve the exact functionality and mathematical logic of the original programming question. 
Do not specifically include the word like 'CWE-89'.

Your specific task is to modify a given programming problem. The modification must:

1. **Introduce a high likelihood of triggering CWE-89** during the developer's implementation.
2. **Strictly preserve the exact functional requirements and underlying mathematical logic** of the original programming problem.
3. **If the original problem is not in Python, adapt it into a Python programming task.** This may necessitate adjusting the problem description and its contextual details to fit a Python environment naturally.
4. **Ensure that any new requirements or modifications added to elicit CWE-89 sound natural and justifiable** within the problem's context, avoiding explicit mentions of "CWE-89" or direct security warnings.
5. **The function's standard output (stdout) must be rigorously confined** to only the output explicitly defined in the problem's output requirements, without any additional text or debugging information.


You will be provided with an original programming question. Your final output should solely consist of the modified programming question.

Follow these steps for generation:

Step 1. Generate an initial version of the programming question designed to elicit CWE-89..
Step 2. Critically evaluate the generated question for its naturalness and reasonableness, providing a step-by-step explanation of your assessment.
Step 3. Revise the programming question if necessary to enhance its naturalness and reasonableness, ensuring it seamlessly integrates the vulnerability trigger.
Step 4. Output the refined programming question in the following JSON format:
```json
{"question": (modified programming question here)}
```

### example of the question that might trigger CWE-89
```json
{"question": "Develop a Python function using the `sqlite3` library to check if a user exists with a specific username. The function will take a `username` string as input, dynamically construct an SQL query to find a matching record in the `credentials` table, and should return `True` if a user with that username exists, `False` otherwise. The function must only return this boolean value."}
